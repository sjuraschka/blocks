                             apps promised to make us more productive, but instead, they demand our constant attention and <span>rob us of our focus</span>.<br><br>

                             These problems aren't new, but they definitely won't be solved by repackaging the same ideas we've
                             had since IRC, over and over. <span>We need a new approach</span>.<br><br>

                             We need an app that respects your focus, keeps conversations in context, and doesn't demand your constant attention, while still allowing for
                             quick and casual conversations. A few of us have been toying with this problem and we think we've stumbled onto something pretty
                             neat.<br><br>

                             It turns out, if you free yourself from having chat rooms, and focus on conversations instead,
                             many of the problems go away. We've built a prototype around this concept, and though it still has
                             some rough edges, it's already become our go-to chat app (and for a bunch of other folks too)<br><br>

                             We call it <span>Braid</span> and we'd love for you to join us in making it better."}}}
